DELI-cious is a full-featured Java application simulating a deli ordering system.
Users can customize sandwiches, add chips and drinks, review order summaries, 
and generate timestamped receipts. Built with clean OOP principles, the project includes a CLI,
a GUI (JavaFX/Swing), full JUnit test coverage, and GitHub Actions for continuous integration.
